## What animals can you look after?

I can look after dogs, cats, and other small mammals. If you're not sure if that
covers your pet, [please get in touch]({{< relref "/contact" >}} "Contact me").

## What's included in an overnight stay?

Normally, an overnight means I'll arrive in the evening to feed your pet and
give them a toilet break. And of course I'll spend some time playing or
cuddling, or whatever else your pet likes to do! I'll then stay the night, and
do the same in the morning before I leave for the day. If it's a multiple night
stay, I'll be out during the day and back again in the evening. If your pets
have separation anxiety or don't like being left alone, I also provide a drop-in
service or we can discuss other options.

I'll provide food for myself and always carry a supply of poo bags, but
otherwise you'll be expected to provide your pets' own food, toys, etc.

I'm a good house guest and I'll keep your home tidy and clean up after myself,
and I can even water your plants for you!

## How do drop-ins work?

During a drop-in, I will visit your home during the day. I can feed if
necessary, check water, give them a toilet break, clean out litter trays, and
spend some quality time together. Drop-ins typically last around half an hour.

Please let me know when booking if you need these to be at specific times or for
longer than 30 minutes.

## How many dogs do you walk at a time?

The number of dogs I can walk at once will depend on their size and temperament.
I only walk dogs from the same household together, so they get my full
attention. Some dogs don't like walking with other dogs, and I want this to be a
positive and enriching experience for them.

## Can you give my pet their medication?

I'm able to administer oral and topical medications for your pets. If they are
given medication by injection, I may be able to do this for you. Please get in
touch to discuss further details.

## I have another question

I'm always happy to answer any questions you might have. [Please get in
