## Hi! I’m Nova

I'm located in Dewsbury, having made the move from London, where I worked in
kennels at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home for just over 5 years.

I’ve worked professionally with animals for over 15 years in various roles, and
while at Battersea I had a reputation for helping scared dogs come out of their
shells, which just so happened to be my favourite part of the job! I’m a firm
believer in treating every animal as an individual and am skilled at identifying
the needs of the animals in my care. You won’t see me walking an entire pack of
dogs from different households together, because I want to give each animal the
attention and care they need and deserve. What you will see me doing is meeting
your pets where they are and tailoring my approach with patience and kindness.
The ultimate goal for me is to make sure your fur babies have a great time. I’m
not happy until they’re happy!

Over the years I’ve worked with thousands of animals, from the happy-go-lucky
well-socialised pets, to former street dogs and feral cats, sick and frightened
veterinary patients, shut down or fear-aggressive dogs, and dogs that would
eventually go on to become working dogs for security firms, in prisons etc. I’ve
also been fortunate enough to have worked alongside some amazing vets, nurses,
behaviourists and carers, and from them picked up many of the things I consider
valuable and now put into practise.

In addition to my patient and compassionate attitude, I have experience with and
knowledge of:

- Loose-lead walking
- T-touch basics
- Pharmacognosy basics (aromatherapy)
- Reward-based behaviour modification
- Safe and effective handling techniques and equipment
- Reading body language
- Enrichment
- Breed traits
- Some basic nursing skills
- Hygiene and infection control
- Senior care
- Puppy socialisation

Making new fur friends is always the highlight of my day, so if I sound like a
good match, please do get in touch!
