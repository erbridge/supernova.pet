    We had regular updates and pictures of Murphy from Nova... I would
    definitely recommend Nova to anyone who wants their dog well looked after
    whilst you're away on holiday.

    Nova has been absolutely Fantastic with our dog while we went away. I felt
    apprehensive leaving him with a sitter but Nova made me feel totally at ease
    and I knew he was in safe hands.

    Fantastic sitter, taking our Bella for regular walks, advising and providing
    with useful professional information... If you're looking for someone to
    look after your beloved pets, Nova is the best choice!!

    I returned from my holidays to a tidy home and with my babies all in good
    condition. Nova went above & beyond as my pups are attention seekers and
    they managed them so well. I would have Nova to look after them again.

    When I arrived home the house has been left clean and tidy. I would
    recommend Nova to anyone who is looking for someone to take care of your
    pet.
