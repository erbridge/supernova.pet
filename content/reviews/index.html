    Nova was so great with our rescue staffy cross Duke. We had a meet and greet
    before and I've never seen Duke be so relaxed so quickly when meeting a new
    person before! Nova looked after Duke on New Year's Eve and he is really
    scared of fireworks so it can't have been easy! They were so understanding
    of his needs and administered his medication no problem. They also sent us
    updates and photos which were really reassuring! We'd definitely book with
    Nova again! ☺️

    Having just returned from holiday, our dogs are the least sulky we have ever
    know them after returning, they are both relaxed and look in excellent
    condition, dare I say it, its almost like our dogs have enjoyed a holiday
    without us, which is all down to Nova. So, about Nova, I cannot praise Nova
    highly enough... I would 100% recommend Nova as a dog sitter, in fact the
    world would be a much better place if there were more people like Nova, a
    lovely person who adores our four legged friends. Thank you Nova, you have
    been perfect and exceeded our expectations.

    We had regular updates and pictures of Murphy from Nova... I would
    definitely recommend Nova to anyone who wants their dog well looked after
    whilst you're away on holiday.

    Nova has been absolutely Fantastic with our dog while we went away. I felt
    apprehensive leaving him with a sitter but Nova made me feel totally at ease
    and I knew he was in safe hands.

    Fantastic sitter, taking our Bella for regular walks, advising and providing
    with useful professional information... If you're looking for someone to
    look after your beloved pets, Nova is the best choice!!

    I returned from my holidays to a tidy home and with my babies all in good
    condition. Nova went above & beyond as my pups are attention seekers and
    they managed them so well. I would have Nova to look after them again.

    When I arrived home the house has been left clean and tidy. I would
    recommend Nova to anyone who is looking for someone to take care of your
    pet.
