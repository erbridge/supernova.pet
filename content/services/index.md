It’s important to me that your pets feel happy and comfortable with me before we
have any one-on-one time, so my preference is to have a meet and greet with you
and your pets first, to make sure we’re a good fit and to discuss your and your
pets’ needs. If there’s anything you’d like to discuss in advance [I’m always
happy to answer any queries you may have]({{< relref "/contact" >}}
"Contact me").
